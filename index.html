                All web projects these days make use of the full web stack (HTML, CSS and JavaScript). 
                With front-end conventions and rendering conformance being more comment across browser vendors we at Lunatech Labs have started shedding the extra bloat of the past and are looking forward to make the best web experience. Each and every time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To make the this process even easier we've started using pre-parsers like LESS and SASS. 
                For its simplicity and ease of use right out of the box we've opted for LESS. Skinning a web site has never been this effortless.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first thing to point out is that this isn't a kitchen sink project like HTML5 Boilerplate. We've voided the need to trim down the front-end, in fact it assumes that you will tinker around.
